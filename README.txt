Formula
=======

This package contains an implementation of symbolic statistical models in
Python.

The implementation is of a full algebra of factors and numerical variables in
statistical models.

It has some similarities to model formulae in R, but differs in that the rules
for the creation of design matrices are more completely defined by the model
algebra.

An earlier version of this package is in nipy_.
